    <h1>FUTURE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The job that I want to do in future is web development, so this is why I choose to study computer science. Front-end involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website, typically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development focuses on server-side logic, databases, and server configuration, often using languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js. Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end.</p>
